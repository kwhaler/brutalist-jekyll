# Brutalist Jekyll

Brutalism in design focuses on 'raw' materialism. I decided to make a Jekyllrb site that embodies this direction by removing all but essential style, adopting Tufte's thoughts on contrast and portwar era typographic principles (eh, sans-serif). And [mrmrs](https://github.com/mrmrs/colors) better color defaults.

Basically, what you get is cleaner starting point. 

The css files replace the default css. Should work with any recent version of Jekyllrb.
